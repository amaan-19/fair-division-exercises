# Fair Division Exercises

Welcome to our educational project on **fair division and cake-cutting algorithms**.

This site provides learning resources and documentation designed to explore algorithmic fairness in the division of both divisible and indivisible goods.

## Algorithms

### [Austin's Moving-Knife Procedure](algorithms/austin-moving-knife)
An extension of the divide-and-choose procedure using a "moving knife" approach.

## Status

This project is currently in early development. Additional algorithms, exercises, and educational materials will be added iteratively.
